RECOMMENDATIONS
1. The most preferred Cuisine by consumers appears to be the Mexican cuisine so Maven analytics looking to
 invest in a restaurant business should do so and include mexican cuisine in the menu which is the most requested for sales and general growth of the business
2. The location of the proposed restaurant should be accessible to those who ply public transport as they represent majority of consumers
3. 89% of the total consumers are single so efforts should be made to make the restaurant appealing to married persons as well to drive more sales.
4. Youths make the majority of consumers as well as medium budget consumers so the prices of the meals
 should be decided in consideration of the Youths who are mostly students and junior salary earners 
5. Majority of the consumers are non-abstemious so including a couple of choice drinks to the menu will attract more consumers and make the restaurant their favourite spot
6. San Luis Potosi, Mexico houses the restaurant with the highest ratings so Maven may consider San Luis as a choice location to establish its business which already has the consumer population/target audience
